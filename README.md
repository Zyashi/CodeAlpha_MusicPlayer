## How to Add Songs
This project does not include audio files due to file size limitations on GitHub.  
To test the music player:

1. Create a folder named `assets/audio/` inside the project (already present if cloned).
2. Add your `.mp3` files in that folder.
3. Make sure the file names match the ones used in `script.js`, or update the playlist in the code with your own file names.

Example:

assets/
└── audio/
     ├── track1.mp3
     ├── track2.mp3
     └── track3.mp3

---
⚠️ Note: Audio files are not included due to GitHub size limits.  
Please add your own MP3 files inside the `assets/music/` folder to test the player.
